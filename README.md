# 2016-COMAP---Refugee-Policies
The MATLAB implementation of the first question of problem F of 2016 COMAP's Mathematical Contest in Modeling. Grouped with Jiajun Zhang and Jiarui Xu, and won the Finalist.

The first question is to model the refugee flow. We chose 6 coutries in middle east as source country, 6 countries in Europe as intermediate country, and 6 countries in Europe as destination.

The decision for refugees to choose the destination depends on the expected net income, the refugee policy, and the resident satisfaction factor in the destination. The route for those refugees is decided on the cost and the risk on the route.
